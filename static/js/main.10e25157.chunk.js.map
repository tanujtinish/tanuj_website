My father holds a Ph.D. and is a Professor of Mechanical Engineering. My Mother holds a Masterâ€™s Degree in Bio-Chemistry and is a Professor of Chemistry. Observing my parents creating an impact on society through education inspired me to excel in academics. I proved to be a bright student in school and often stood in the top 3 of my class. On top of that, having a twin brother helped create positive competition in the house. We always strived to out-perform each other while learning from each other. This eventually helped us become active participants in various extra-curricular and co-curricular activities at school. We represented the school in a few science competitions and helped in organizing various events at school. We both topped our junior school with a 10 on 10 GPA. I was also conferred with the position of House captain in high school that helped build my leadership skills. I feel, my family played a primary role to help me excel in life and build my personality most positively, something I am really grateful for.</p>\r\n\t\t\t\t<p>My parents had a liberal mindset and always taught me to strive for creating a society where everyone has equal opportunities. Having deep roots in academia, they always advocated the significance of education for uplifting the weaker sections of society. Be it my mother: a chemistry professor giving free chemistry classes to the underprivileged, or my father: a professor of mechanical engineering who used the research opportunities to find cost-effective solutions, they always used their education as an opportunity to uplift the economically weaker sections of the society. Motivated by our parents to innovate and create an impact on society, I and my brother decided to pursue engineering. Our interest in science and mathematics helped us secure admission to the best Engineering Universities: BITS Pilani and IIT Delhi, both ranked among the top 10 Universities in India. </p> \r\n\t\t\t\t<p>My journey as a Computer Science undergraduate student started at BITS Pilani. It was the first time I was away from my twin brother, something that was a tremendous change in my lifestyle. Initially, it proved to be a hurdle to my performance in class. Luckily, BITS had an immense culture of extra-curricular and co-curricular activities that helped me pursue my hobbies, make new friends, and assimilate into college culture. I joined the dance society and BITSMUN society at the University. Making choreographies as a member of the dance club helped me nurture my creative side, something I feel has helped me excel as a computer scientist as well. I also took part in various MUN dialogues organized by the BITSMUN society. These MUN dialogues helped me get a deep understanding of the world on a socio-cultural, political, and economic level.</p> \r\n\t\t\t\t<p>One of the turning points was when I joined the national service scheme (NSS) society at college in my sophomore year. NSS BPHC gave the students opportunities to volunteer for supporting those in need: rural citizens, economically disadvantaged school children, and orphans. Inspired by the principles I learned from my parents, I volunteered for a one-month long Educational Outreach Program. Here I took Logical Reasoning classes for the high school students in a rural area, aiming to improve their Aptitude skills and Critical thinking. I had a few interactive sessions with these students after the classes. I noticed, despite the lack of proper infrastructure, facilities, and opportunities at their school, some of these students were performing well in their areas of interest. I came to know that these kids were making use of mobile phones and the internet to learn and quench their day-to-day curiosity. I noticed how the advancement in technology has made education, a basic necessity for life, so much more accessible. These kids, who could hardly meet their daily needs, are now just a click away to access the best education in the world. This experience convinced me that affordable technology holds the power to unite humanity under one umbrella, providing equal opportunities for all. Since then, my propensity for contributing to the development of technology and making it affordable has only grown. </p> \r\n\t\t\t\t<p>In my junior and senior year, I found myself heavily inclined towards practically oriented learning. I wanted to become capable enough to build affordable technology that can bring an enormous impact on society. I always made sure to implement the knowledge I learned in classes. It was at the beginning of this year (2020) when the COVID-19 pandemic hit the world; I realized that technology truly holds the potential to bring a positive change into our society. The Pandemic had a devastating impact on public health, food systems, and the world of work. But it also opened various opportunities for the technology enthusiasts to leverage their skill set to help fight against COVID-19 (coronavirus). Having had almost a year of experience in the industry, I got a chance to leverage my skill set as well. 6 lakh ASHA workers provide door-to-door last mile healthcare to 70% of the Indian population in rural areas. It is very difficult for these workers to serve every house on a daily basis, especially in times of pandemic. We realized, with a few months of effort, we can make a significant difference in their lives while significantly improving access to healthcare in rural areas. We are developing an application to enable real-time patient monitoring and triage of healthcare problems to decrease the workload on community healthcare ASHA workers, and enabling them to deliver care, effectively. While I am working here, I understand how technology can have an exponential effect to make the world a better place to live.</p> \r\n\t\t\t\t</div>\r\n\t\t\t\t</div>\r\n\t\t\t\t</div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<h1>Cources taken</h1>\r\n\t\t\t\t<Menu places={this.state.places} />\r\n\t\t\t</div>\r\n\t\t);\r\n\t}\r\n}\r\n\r\nexport default Main;","import React from 'react';\r\n\r\nclass Greet extends React.Component {\r\n\t\r\n\tconstructor(props){\r\n\t\tsuper(props);\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\tthis.state = {val: \"awesome\"};\r\n\t}\r\n\t\r\n\t\r\n\tchangeValue = () => {\r\n\t\tthis.setState(\r\n\t\t\t{val: \"wonderful\"}\r\n\t\t\t);\r\n\t\t}\r\n\t\r\n\trender(){\r\n\t\treturn(\r\n\t\t\t<div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<h1>About Me</h1>\r\n\t\t\t</div>\r\n\t\t);\r\n\t}\r\n}\r\n\r\n\r\nexport default Greet;","import React, { Component } from 'react';\n// import PageRoutes from './PageRoutes'\nimport Main from './pages/UIS/Main'\n\nclass App extends Component {\n  render() {\n    return (\n    \t<Main/>\n      // <PageRoutes/>\n              // <Route path=\"/main\" component={Main} exact/>\n\n    );\n  }\n}\n\nexport default App;\n","const reportWebVitals = onPerfEntry => {\n  if (onPerfEntry && onPerfEntry instanceof Function) {\n    import('web-vitals').then(({ getCLS, getFID, getFCP, getLCP, getTTFB }) => {\n      getCLS(onPerfEntry);\n      getFID(onPerfEntry);\n      getFCP(onPerfEntry);\n      getLCP(onPerfEntry);\n      getTTFB(onPerfEntry);\n    });\n  }\n};\n\nexport default reportWebVitals;\n","import React from 'react';\nimport ReactDOM from 'react-dom';\nimport 'bootstrap/dist/css/bootstrap.min.css';\nimport './index.css';\nimport App from './App';\nimport reportWebVitals from './reportWebVitals';\n\nReactDOM.render(\n  <React.StrictMode>\n    <App />\n  </React.StrictMode>,\n  document.getElementById('root')\n);\n\n// If you want to start measuring performance in your app, pass a function\n// to log results (for example: reportWebVitals(console.log))\n// or send to an analytics endpoint.
